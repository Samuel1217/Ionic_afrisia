Common points for both Builds :

1. I have added a new field in restaurant listing API named "Open Days". Just show its value about Lunch and Dinner Timing in restaurant listing.
(API not ready)
2. Arrange all dishes, categories, sides and options in alphabetical order.
(Server order needs)
3. I am still able to select any number of options and sides for a particular dish.
    There is a parameter named "sides_limit" and "options_limit" in dish listing API which would tell how many max. sides/options a user can select.
(Check again)
4. The selection of the category is not visible.
(complete)
